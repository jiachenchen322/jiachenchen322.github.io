## Featured Work

### Frailty and Cognitive Aging: Shared Mechanisms

This research investigates the interconnected biological mechanisms driving both physical frailty and cognitive decline, including chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation. Using AI/ML tools and multi-omics integration, we aim to identify mechanisms and pathways that explain the shared underpinnings between frailty phenotypes and neurodegenerative processes.

### Inflammation, Immunosenescence, and Cognitive Aging
This research series investigates how peripheral inflammation and immunosenescence contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia, using data from the Framingham Heart Study. Through a combination of inflammatory protein profiling, immune cell phenotyping, and brain imaging, these studies have advanced our understanding of systemic aging and brain health.
