## Project Overview

This project investigates the roles of peripheral inflammation and immunosenescence in the development of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD). Through a series of studies leveraging the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, we explore how circulating inflammatory proteins and immune cell phenotypes are associated with cognitive function, brain MRI measures, and long-term dementia risk.

Our objective is to identify biological pathways linking chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neurodegeneration, with the goal of discovering early biomarkers and intervention targets.

## Other Related Outputs

Beyond the central focus on inflammation and cognitive aging, our broader body of work explores how peripheral immune phenotypes and inflammatory proteins relate to biological aging, lifestyle factors, and mortality. These complementary studies have examined immune-aging connections with epigenetic clocks, alcohol use, sleep disruption, depressive symptoms, and thymic health, offering a more comprehensive view of the immunosenescence landscape across aging trajectories.
