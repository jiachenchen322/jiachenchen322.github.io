Hi! I’m Jiachen Chen, a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Boston University School of Public Health.

My research focuses on integrating multi-omics data and leveraging AI/ML models to understand aging and Alzheimer’s Disease. I am especially interested in identifying molecular mechanisms linking frailty, inflammation, and cognitive decline.

This site highlights my current work, publications, and academic journey.
