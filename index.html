Hi! I’m Jiachen Chen, a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Boston University School of Public Health, advised by Dr. Kathryn Lunetta and Dr. Joanne Murabito. My research lies at the intersection of multi-omics integration, aging, and statistical machine learning, with a focus on uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying frailty and cognitive decline.

Before joining BU, I completed my M.S. in Biostatistics at Yale, where I worked on clinical trial design and developed the swdpwr software for power calculations in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials. I also hold dual bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Finance from Tianjin University and Nankai University.

My recent work involves developing interpretable AI/ML architectures and statistical network models to integrate proteomics and immune cell data with cognitive aging phenotypes. Leveraging large-scale cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study and UK Biobank, I aim to identify shared biological pathways linking chronic inflammation, physical frailty, and Alzheimer’s Disease.

This site showcases my research, publications, and academic journey.
